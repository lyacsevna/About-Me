## I'm just learning ðŸ‘½

This is my portfolio app. It is designed to practice front-end development skills and does not bring any value... However, thanks to the app, you will be able to get to know me a little more.

The project contains the following sections:

- **About me**
- **Education**
- **Projects**
- **Contacts**

## Installation and launch

My website is still UNDER DEVELOPMENT and has not been published. So to check it out, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyacsevna/AboutMe.git
```

2. Go to the project directory:

```bash
cd AboutMe
```
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
4. Run the project:

```bash
npm start
```

Now you can open the application in the browser at http://localhost:3000.
